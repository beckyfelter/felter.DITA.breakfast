            <step>
                <cmd>With your finger, tear small pieces of sausage and add them in a single layer to a large heavy skillet.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Brown the sausage over medium-high heat until no longer pink.</cmd>

            <step>
                <cmd>Reduce the heat to medium-low.</cmd>

            <step>
                <cmd>Sprinkle on half the flour and stir so that the sausage soaks it all up, then add more little by little.</cmd>

                <cmd>Stir it around and cook it for another minute or so, then pour in the milk, stirring constantly.</cmd>
